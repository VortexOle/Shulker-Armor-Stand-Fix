# Shulker Armor Stand Fix

Hacky fix for the bug MC-266334 which allows shulker to break armor stands.

This mod is basically a replica of [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/shulkerfix) mod but their version (for some to me unknown reason) only supports the version 1.21.1 (where this bug is already fixed) so I downported it to the versions it actually needs to be in.

## Requirements

This mod relies on Fabric and the Fabric API. You need to use the fabric loader version  >= 0.16.9 for this mod.

## Contributions

Even though there isn't much code for this project I'm aware that my coding skills are subpar so any contributions for my horrible code are welcome.
